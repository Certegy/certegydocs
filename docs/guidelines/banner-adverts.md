# Adding an Oxipay Banner

Placing an Oxipay Banner on your website is a good way to introduce Oxipay to your users and drive more sales through your store. So we have created this documentation to give you a selection of banners to choose from and display on your websites. 

 
##Installing the Banners and Tags
<strong>Step 1:</strong> Choose the Banner or Tag that you want to install from our <a href="/guidelines/banners">Banners and Tags list</a>. 
<br><strong>Step 2:</strong> Place the ```<script>``` tag in the desired place you'd like it to appear on your website. Depending on how your website is made this may vary.
<br><br>Shopify uses can follow this guide to modify their layouts [Customizing themes](https://help.shopify.com/themes/customization#view-the-edit-html-css-page) 
<br><br>We recommened placing the Banner in your base layout html page so it will appear on all pages in your website. The tag should be placed under the price variable on your products single page. 
<br><br><strong>Step 3:</strong> Save and you should see a working Banner or Tag on the pages you edited.

### Working Example:
<script id="oxipay-banner" src="https://oxipay.com.au/widgets/register-interest-large.js"></script>
