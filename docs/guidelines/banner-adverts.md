# Adding an Oxipay Banner

Advertising Oxipay on your website is a good way to introduce your users to the Oxipay service and drive more sales through your store. So we have created a selection of banners for you to chose from and display on your websites. 
For ease of use we have created two ways for you to display Oxipay branding on your website. The first way was created to require minimal HTML knowledge and the second way requires intimediate HTML/CSS and JavaScript knowledge.

While we do provide two methods to display Oxipay on your website. We do highly recommend that you choose the second approach if possible. The complex way will it is harder to set up intially is the better choice out of the two options. It will proved your costmers with a better viewing experince and possible increase sales.
